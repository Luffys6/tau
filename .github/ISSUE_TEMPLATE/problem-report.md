# I made a resolution, for this new year :

I will never handle anymore a PR (Problem Report) which is posted without :
- Your target : Android, iOS or Flutter Web
- The result of  ```flutter pub deps | grep flutter_sound```
- Your logs

Without those three basic informations, I will close your PR without answering anything. I cannot spend all my times requesting over and over : 
```
I need your logs
```
